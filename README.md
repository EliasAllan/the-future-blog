# The Future Blog

## Description 
This is a blog-style website that was created as a homework for module 14 of the coding bootcamp. It was created with the idea of publishing articles, blog posts and thoughts and opinions.

## Installation  
```md
make sure you're inside the root folder using the cd(change directory) command
run npm -i on your terminal 
Rename .env.EXAMPLE to .env and fill in the blank spaces
create database by running mysql -u root -p < db/schema.sql on the terminal
run seed file by running npm run seed on the terminal
run the server file by runnin npx nodemon server on the terminal
```

## Technologies
This website was made by connecting the dynamic and responsive front-end using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap) and JavaScript, to the responsive and interactive back-end using Handlebars.js (as the template engine), MySQL and the Sequelize ORM (for the database), GET and POST routes (for adding new data and retrieving) and utilized session authentication. This website is powered by Heroku.
